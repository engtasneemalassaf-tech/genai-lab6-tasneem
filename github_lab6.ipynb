Here’s a fun fact about AI: The first AI program was developed in 1951 by Christopher Strachey, who later became the director of the Programming Research Group at the University of Oxford. He created a checkers (draughts) program that was able to play the game at a reasonable level, and he ran it on the Ferranti Mark I computer, one of the first commercially available computers. This early example of AI set the stage for the development of more complex algorithms and applications we see today!\n"
